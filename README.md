Design Patterns in ABAP Objects

This repository is container of the Design Patterns applied specifically for the ABAP language. The examples were taken from the book of Kerem Koseoglu - "Design Patterns in ABAP Objects".

The main package is "$EM_DESIGN_PATTERNS" that contains the following subpackages related to the classification of the design patterns:
1) $EM_ARCHITECTURAL_DP - Architectural Design Patterns
2) $EM_BEHAVIORAL_DP - Behavioral Design Patterns
3) $EM_CREATIONAL_DP - Creational Design Patterns
4) $EM_STRUCTURAL_DP - Structural Design Patterns

In each of these subpackages there is a package that contains all the objects related to the pattern that is being analyzed. The objects can be Dictionay Objects, Classes and Interfaces that implement the pattern and in most cases there is a program (in some cases more than one) that shows how the pattern is applied.
